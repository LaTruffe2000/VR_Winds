Gather various wind files for Virtual Regatta

Set of python scripts that gather various grib files from NOAA and ECMWF and generate a grib file to be used in router software such as qtvlm

Track2GPX can be used to transform a track retrieve from VR (through the getboatinfo) into a GPX track, that can be imported in another software.
